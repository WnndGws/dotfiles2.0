# Pandoc’s Built-in Styles

    pandoc v2.0.5 | v1.19.2

In this folder you’ll find the standalone CSS stylesheets of pandoc’s eight built-in styles (syntax highlighting themes):

1.  [`breezedark.css`](./breezedark.css)
2.  [`espresso.css`](./espresso.css)
3.  [`haddock.css`](./haddock.css)
4.  [`kate.css`](./kate.css)
5.  [`monochrome.css`](./monochrome.css)
6.  [`pygments.css`](./pygments.css) (default style)
7.  [`tango.css`](./tango.css)
8.  [`zenburn.css`](./zenburn.css)

The stylesheets were extracted from standalone HTML5 documents created with pandoc `v2.0.5`, using the `--highlight-style` option. A comment block with extra info was added at the beginning of each stylesheet.

They are intended as a examples and quick reference when developing custom styles (see [License](#license) section below).

> __NOTE__ — pandoc v2.0.4 introduced some breaking changes in the way code is highlighted in html output. (For more info, see [parent folder's `README`][parent README])

## Pandoc v1 Styles

  - [`/pandoc_v1/`](./pandoc_v1/)

In the “[`/pandoc_v1/`](./pandoc_v1/)” you’ll’ find the equivalent files for pandoc v1 — version 2 introduced some changes in syntax highlighting HTML tags and built-in styles’ CSS, so the old files are kept for projects that still require pandoc `v1.x`.

From [pandoc v2.0 release notes](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.0):

> The way highlighted code blocks are formatted in HTML has been changed (David Baynard), in ways that may require changes in hard-coded CSS affecting highlighting. (If you haven’t included hard-coded highlighting CSS in your template, you needn’t change anything.)

Most notably, line-numbered code dosen’t use HTML tables anymore.

# About The Styles

## Color Themes Inspiration

Some info about the original themes these pandoc styles are based on (info taken from [skylighting source](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting/blob/master/src/Skylighting/Styles.hs) and further research).

  - **breezedark** — Style from the “Breeze Dark” KDE syntax highlighting theme.
  - **espresso** — Style based on [ultraviolet](https://rubygems.org/gems/ultraviolet/versions/0.10.0)’s “[`espresso_libre.css`](https://github.com/spox/ultraviolet/blob/master/render/xhtml/files/css/espresso_libre.css)” (dark background)
  - **haddock** — Style based on [Haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/)’s source highlighting.
  - **kate** — Style based on Kate’s default colors.
  - **monochrome** — Style with no colors.
  - **pygments** — Style based on [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)’ [default colors](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/src/default/pygments/styles/default.py).
  - **tango** — Style based on [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)’ “[tango](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/src/default/pygments/styles/tango.py)” colors.
  - **zenburn** — Style based on the popular “[Zenburn](http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/)” Vim color scheme.

## License

  - [LICENSE](./LICENSE) — Pandoc license file.
  - [GPL-2.0](./GPL-2.0) — GNU-GPL v2 license file.

Pandoc’s built-in styles are dynamically generated by the skylighting library — ie: the actual CSS stylesheets are not present in pandoc’s nor skylighting’s source code, but are generated programmatically from a set a hardcoded values. The code that generates them can be seen here:

  - <https://github.com/jgm/skylighting/blob/master/src/Skylighting/Styles.hs>

The CSS stylesheets of the syntax styles (aka “themes”) fall under the same license governing pandoc: **GPL v2** (or greater).

Pandoc’s built-in default templates are maintained on a repository of their own, and they are dual-licensed — under both the **GPL** (**v2** or higher, same as pandoc) and the **BSD 3-clause** (“New” or “Revised”) license:

  - <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates>

Even though pandoc templates are dual licensed, the actual CSS styles are not part of the HTML4/HTML5 templates, they are dynamically generated by pandoc and injected into the template when the following is encounterd:

    $if(highlighting-css)$
      <style type="text/css">
    $highlighting-css$
      </style>
    $endif$

It’s therefore safer to assume that the introduction of the built-in CSS stylesheets in a template or a final document excludes the **BSD 3-clause** license option, leaving as the only viable choice the **GPL v2** (or greater) license which is common to both templates and stylesheets.
