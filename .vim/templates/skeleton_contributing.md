# Contributing
I want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug/error
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Proposing improvements

## I Develop with GitHub
I use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### I Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
So all code changes happen through pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

To see an example of a "fork-PR" process, see [here](https://gist.github.com/WnndGws/3beade5a786da8f30be7eb9dcd2c37b9)

### Report bugs using GitHub's issues
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
